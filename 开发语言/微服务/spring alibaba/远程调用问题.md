 ERROR [c.x.m.c.s.feign.MicroSentinelInvocationHandler] MicroSentinelInvocationHandler.java:125 - feign 服务间调用异常
org.springframework.beans.factory.support.ScopeNotActiveException: Error creating bean with name 'scopedTarget.oauth2ClientContext': Scope 'request' is not active for the current thread; consider defining a scoped proxy for this bean if you intend to refer to it from a singleton; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalStateException: No thread-bound request found: Are you referring to request attributes outside of an actual web request, or processing a request outside of the originally receiving thread? If you are actually operating within a web request and still receive this message, your code is probably running outside of DispatcherServlet: In this case, use RequestContextListener or RequestContextFilter to expose the current request.
